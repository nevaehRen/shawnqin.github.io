			<h1>About me</h1>
			<p>I am currently a PhD student who is interested in applying physical theories and approaches to gain better understanding of various biological systems. I have been working on biological dynamical systems for a while, and now I am mainly focusing on catastrophic transitions in complex dynamical systems and understanding how olfactory systems work.<\p>
			<p>I am skilled with modeling and analyzing biological networks. For instance, bifurcation analysis, sensitivity analysis, robustness analysis. I am also interested in a wider range of research areas, such as neuroscience, psychology, artificial intelegence and the history of sciecne.</p>
