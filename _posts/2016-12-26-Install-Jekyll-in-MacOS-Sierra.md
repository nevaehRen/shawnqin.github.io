Following the tutorial to install ruby, Jekyll and configuration:  

* [Install ruby](https://gorails.com/setup/osx/10.12-sierra)  

* [Install Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/)  

* [trouble shooting](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/troubleshooting/#installation-problems)  

The problem here is that the latest version of Ruby (2.4.0) is not compatible with MacOS Sierra. In stead, ruby 2.3.3 seems work well.
