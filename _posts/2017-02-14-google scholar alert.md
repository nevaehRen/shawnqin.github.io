Here is some information about how to get up-to-date alerts from Google Scholar or Web of Knowledge.

* You can use Google scholar alerts to track the citation of your own and other's publications. Here is a tutorial of how to set the [alerts](http://blog.impactstory.org/ultimate-guide-for-articles/). This post also gives information about similar settings in Web of Knowledge.

* If you just want to receive information of newly published papers regularly, say once a week, follow the instruction posted [here](http://coreyebaker.com/rtphd-how-to-create-google-scholar-alerts-to-stay-up-to-date/). In order to make your query more accurate, you can use google search operators, which can be found [here](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433?visit_id=1-636226326076755127-1370285248&rd=1). For example, you can use *OR* between two words to match either of them, while you can use *-* to exclude a word. And you can use *""* to do exact matching.

* Another direct way to create google alerts can be found [here](https://scholar.googleblog.com/2010/06/google-scholar-alerts.html). By simply typing the phrases in the google scholar search box and you will find an envelope icon on the left site, then click that icon, you create the alterts.
